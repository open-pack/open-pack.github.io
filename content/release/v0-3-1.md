### Tutorial Dataset (Updated: 2023-03-29)

In the Full Dataset, the data and label files are published into separate files, and we received many comments that it was difficult to perform preliminary analysis.
Therefore, for tutorial purposes, we have created a CSV file containing the four IMU sensor data and the work operation labels.
Before downloading the Full Dataset, please check the contents of the data in this CSV.

Please access Google Drive from the following URL and download the file.
Labels have been slightly changed from those on zenodo (v0.3.1) to correct annotation errors. Please be aware of this.
We plan to integrate the data distribution location into zenodo in the next release.
