            <h3>A. No Private Sharing Outside Teams</h3>
            <p>
              Privately sharing code or data outside of teams is not permitted.
              Itâ€™s OK to share code if made available to all participants on the
              forum.
            </p>
            <h3>B. External Dataset</h3>
            <p>
              You may use data other than the competition data to develop and
              test your submission. However, you will ensure the external data
              is publicly available to everyone without any cost.
