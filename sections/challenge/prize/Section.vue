              At least one person from the top-3 team strongly encouraged to
              attend the award ceremony. We will support the travel fee for the
              attendance up to 1 member (500,000JPY/person) from each winner
              team.

              Update: We were able to secure a budget for three people, so we
              changed our travel fee support from the top-2 to the top-3 teams.
